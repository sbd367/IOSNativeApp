# IOSNativeApp
This is a simple react native application. Written with typescript.

## setup
This project uses a toolchain called [Expo](https://expo.dev/tools) and it's respective CLI [expo-cli](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/expo-cli/)  (Thats why our start/various other scripts use the CLI `expo`)

1. install expo-cli via `npm i -g expo-cli`
2. `npm install`
3. run the command that you feel appropriate: `npm run` `start || android || ios || web || eject || test`

## run start

This will spin up your local server and can use ngrok to tunnel your current changes to Expo. These updates can be viewed in real time on your device using the prompts that appear after using the `npm run start` script (or `expo start`)
